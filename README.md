Abstract
____________________________________

Bioinformatics is a very wide umbrella term and one may not simply describe it in a single sentence. When asked "what is Bioinformatics?" the answer is oftern shrouded with ambiguity and interest in the subject is quickly lost if not answered with enough detail. A way to interact with and possibly introduce the wide world of Bioinformatics with new students could possibly come in the form of an interactive model. This will put the person being asked in less stress when answering, and will also guide those interested towards people who can give a more detailed explanation. This is just a silly project idea that hopefully encourage and offer guidance into the job and career field of Bioinformatics. This will be done in a very basic method where a "personality" quiz is taken, and a model of best fit will be used to determine what careers and paths are available to those who take the quiz. At the end students who are interested may also take a look at other industry or career related paths and broaden their own knowledge of what encompasses Bioinformatics.


Method
____________________________________

A quiz detailing the person's interest regarding questions related to Bioinformatics or related fields will be given. A score is then determined based on the answers and will finally be summed up by offering a career related to that person's interest. This is done by representing the four related fields of study within the program course load of Bioinformatics Aat Langara College. These include (but are not limited to)Biology, Chemistry, Statistics and Computer Science. A graph containing these four fields will be represented onto a cartesian plot. The user will be represented as a dot in the middle of all four and based on their answers; will move either toward or away from a subject. once all the data has been collected, the user will be placed in an area where their interest lies and an example of a career or job related field will be suggested to them. 
Once the user is finished with their specific suggestion, there will be a slider that will enable the user to change the position of the dot in order to see other suggestions or work related fields. This is to offer the user a broader and deeper knowledge of the field of Bioinformatics and may possibly encourage them to start small projects or works on their own.

An example of a run will be simulated here.
