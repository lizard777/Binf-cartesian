Abstract
____________________________________

Bioinformatics is a very wide umbrella term and one may not simply describe it in a single sentence. When asked "what is Bioinformatics?" the answer is oftern shrouded with ambiguity and interest in the subject is quickly lost if not answered with enough detail. A way to interact with and possibly introduce the wide world of Bioinformatics with new students could possibly come in the form of an interactive model. This will put the person being asked in less stress when answering, and will also guide those interested towards people who can give a more detailed explanation. This is just a silly project idea that hopefully encourage and offer guidance into the job and career field of Bioinformatics. This will be done in a very basic method where a "personality" quiz is taken, and a model of best fit will be used to determine what careers and paths are available to those who take the quiz. At the end students who are interested may also take a look at other industry or career related paths and broaden their own knowledge of what encompasses Bioinformatics.
